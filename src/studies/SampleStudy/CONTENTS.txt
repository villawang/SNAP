This is a sample study.
It contains a few .cfg files which are various configurations for the Sample1.py module.
In particular, the extended_run.cfg configures Sample1 to have an extended number of trials.

Also, there are several engine configuration files for different display modes (windowed.prc and fullscreen.prc).

The shortcuts are examples of shortcuts that one might put on the experiment machine's desktop to make an experiment configuration accessible to technicians.
